# FIRM-model
Buy-Hold-Sell predictor

TODO
1. feature engineering (sam's table he showed during the meeting, ask chat gpt how to label buy sell or hold in order to train the model)(feature matrix?)(can use pepsi coke and monster as part of the features matrix(maybe how the thing grows 5 days forward?))
2. input optimization (input more drinks inside without needing to manually add lines to code)
